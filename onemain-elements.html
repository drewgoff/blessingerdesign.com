		<h1>OneMain Elements</h1>
		<h3>Interactive Design System</h3>
		<p>
		 <strong>Problem</strong>
		 <br>
		 Rebranding of a corporation can be refreshing and invigorating, 
		 but it can also create a sink hole in branding execution if
		 the branding guide is geared toward print
		 and doesn’t include data/components for
		 developers. My UX design partner, Drew
		 Goﬀ, and I ran into this issue. The external
		 company that provided the branding guide
		 did not include web or digital media components.
		 <br><br>
		 We created all internal application designs
		 in Adobe Illustrator, but each developer
		 was at liberty to interpret the ﬁnite details.
		 When our layouts were transformed into
		 code we began to see that many of our
		 web applications lacked consistency. Icons
		 were positioned slightly diﬀerent, headers
		 and footers were not consistent, button
		 size and locations varied. It was a problem.
		 <br><br>
		 As this cycle continued, we needed to ﬁnd
		 a way to create a consistent digital brand
		 across applications and for developers
		 whether coded in CSS, Java or Angular. It
		 was not merely the typical "go make a
		 style guide, and everyone will follow it"
		 solution. No, we needed something consistent 
		 and more intuitive for users.
		 <br><br>
		 <strong>Solution</strong>
		 <br>
		 Drew and I got to work. We took it upon
		 ourselves to design and develop a framework 
		 that was universal, on point, matched the 
		 brand guide and useful to the whole development
		 team. The remote developers were especially 
		 grateful. We saved the company valuable man hours
		 and money. Drew developed and I worked
		 on layouts, components and icons. OneMain Elements 
		 lives today and was update with ease when the 
		 company rebranded again a few years later. The 
		 latest rebrand was seamless because of our creation 
		 of OneMain Elements.
